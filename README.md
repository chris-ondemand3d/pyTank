### Pre-requisite 
- git
- python 
- Visual Studio Code

### Source 
On the Windows CMD, (Windows PowerShell-a little variation about the directory specification)
- cd %(dev_directory)   
- git clone https://github.com/chris-ondemand3d/pyTank.git
- cd pyTank
- python -m venv env
- env\Scripts\activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt

### 1st Prompt
create 2d arcade game using pybox2d and pygame, 
2d space with a mountain in the center, 
left side of the mountain, tank controlled by 
- keyboard left arrow "backward",
- right arrow "forward",
- upper arrow to "artillery upward",
- lower arrow "artillery downward",
- space to "shot",
The target is a square box, randomly positioned on the right side of the mountain.

### Initial specification (generated by Claude Opus4)
- Game Elements:

Mountain: Brown polygon in the center of the screen acting as an obstacle
Tank: Gray rectangular tank on the left side with a barrel that rotates
Target: Red square box that spawns randomly on the right side
Projectiles: Yellow circles fired from the tank with realistic physics

- Controls:

Left Arrow: Move tank backward
Right Arrow: Move tank forward
Up Arrow: Raise artillery angle (upward)
Down Arrow: Lower artillery angle (downward)
Space: Fire projectile

- Physics Features:

Realistic gravity and projectile physics using Box2D
Collision detection between projectiles and targets
Tank movement with physics constraints
Projectiles that arc naturally due to gravity

- Game Mechanics:

When you hit a target, it disappears and a new one spawns randomly
Projectiles are automatically removed when they go off-screen
Real-time display of artillery angle
Smooth 60 FPS gameplay

### 2nd prompt
setting velocity_magnitude by the duration of pushing the space button

### Specification 
- Power Gauge System:

Hold Space: Charges up power from minimum to maximum
Release Space: Fires a projectile with the charged power level
Visual Power Gauge: Shows current power level while charging

- Power Gauge Features:

Minimum Power: 10 units (quick tap)
Maximum Power: 40 units (full charge)
Charge Rate: 15 units per second
Color-coded gauge:

Green: Low power (0-30%)
Yellow: Medium power (30-70%)
Red: High power (70-100%)

- Visual Feedback:

Real-time power gauge that appears when holding space
Power level displayed numerically
Smooth color transition based on power level
Updated control instructions

- Gameplay Mechanics:

Short tap = weak shot (good for close targets)
Long hold = powerful shot (can reach distant targets or clear obstacles)
Strategic timing adds a skill element to hitting targets
Power affects both horizontal distance and arc height
